#### Welcome visitor,

This month will be thoughts sharing more than how we faced issues at Guid'me.
Thus it will be shorter, I hope you still appreciate it.

The basic is: We all have to work to live in this world (or maybe you have a secret solution that you could share with [me](mailto:jeremy.pichon@guidme.fr)? ðŸ˜‰).

This does not mean this task should be a painful chore, so I try to make it fun as much as possible.
And I enjoy waking up everyday to do this job I love. Quite a success, isn't?

Sadly, I do not have any magic solution for you to find what will make you happy at work.
I discovered development at 15yo in high school and I knew immediately this is what I would be doing later.

Even if I love my job, not all days are same (thanks!) and some of them can be quite boring.
So I have some examples that I applied to Guid'me to make my journey more enjoyable.

The first one will be the migration to micro-service ([related post]({% post_url 2021-05-01-migration-to-micro-services %})).
I was getting bored of PHP as it has some limitations that were blocking for us, and I wanted to learn Javascript based frameworks.
This was a good occasion to pick some critical API endpoints and migrate them into a micro service.
It helped me to pay a huge tech debt (c.f.: [Pay the tech debt]({% post_url 2021-03-04-pay-the-tech-debt %})) on those endpoints and solved some recurrent issues we had there.

It was a winning point for both business and technical side. Just perfect!
We still have work to do there, but we started to improve and I will keep learning about JS/TS and getting rid of PHP at the same time.
Wonderful.

A second example is this tech blog. I was getting interested in the exercice of writing tech posts.
I wasn't sure what I could talk about as I am not expert. I am just a guy spending most of life doing something he loves: coding.
At some point I just couldn't wait any longer and wanted to write something. So I decided to talk about our journey at Guid'me in general.
Issues we faced, how we solved them, and how we are working here.

There is no objective behind this blog (so far) other than experimenting with tech writing, but who knows? Maybe some people will discover us here and will be interested to work with us in the future.

And it is good for history tracking and remembering where we come from.
