#### Welcome visitor,

Guid'me is a young company and we do not have offices yet. We all have been working remote from the beginning.

Also the tech team members are all living in 3 different timezones (France, Canada, Japan).

The drastic changes caused by the pandemic didn't impact us that much on the technical side.

Remote work could impact your business quite a lot, and I wanted to share how it facilitated our life.

### Business impact

On business side, the biggest pro I can see it about finance. Being full remote workers frees us from renting a place to work.
And this cost can be huge (the place itself and related bills). Just this point allow us to reduce **operating cost** to the strict minimum: the IT infrastructure to provide the service.

Also when the time will come for us to grow, being full remote will allow us to find the best developers from anywhere around the world!

Being a developer myself, this is only the obvious parts I can think of. But be sure that there is other advantages here.

### Technical impact

As mentioned earlier in this post, our main business is based in France. Still, I am currently based in Japan and another collaborator is living in Canada. Not having a mandatory physical place to go everyday allowed us to live wherever we wanted. In my case I could do this, long time waited, long travel to Japan.

Also, something that matters a lot to me is time independence. I do not believe forced 9-to-5 work time is productive for both company and employees. Because we live in different places with big time difference (11h diff between Canada and Japan), we learned to work asynchronously from the beginning. Thus we can manage our work time as we want. I do not feel well today, no problem, take care yourself and come back to work when you feel better.
Another advantage are the meetings frequency. With that time difference and personal life schedules, it can be difficult to find a common time to do video calls. So we keep it to the minimum and we make it worth our time.

The last big advantage I will mention today, that didn't came to our mind at first, is the easiness of 24h support. There is always someone awake to take care of IT if something wrong is hapening.

### Difficulties

Of course, not everything is perfect with remote work, it is not a magical solution.
First, it do not suit everyone. Some people needs to meet their colleagues, and experience solitude by staying at home to work.
Thankfully we do not have such case at Guid'me, but we still regret that we cannot meet as much as we would like to.

Another point is the blurry barrier with the personnal time. I faced this one hard at some point, but it is probably because I love my job.
And I conceive this product from the beginning, it is like my child and I want to make sure it is growing correctly.
If this happens to you, I would suggest that you set a specific period of time to work and stop when the times come. It doesn't matter if you are in the middle of something. It is no good on the long run to work too much, set an alarm if you miss the notion of time when you work.

### Not applicable to us

I could find some disadvantages only that do not apply to us, and I though sharing them could be interesting.

**Harder to build team spirit**

We included remote working in Guid'me's DNA, so we do not face any issue on this side. It requires a lot of communication for sure.
But it is a good quality one and do not waste time wandering around.

**Difficulty to schedule meetings and coordinate**

We have to coordinate between 3 timezones, so it might be even "harder" for us to schedule meetings.
Just prepare them enough in advance, and make sure to define the expected output from this meeting.

**More difficult to supervise work**

We built trust between each others and to get things done.


## Our advices

Here is some advices that were helpful to us:

Use the correct communication tools depending on your needs.
Most of the time meetings are not required, a simple DM over Slack or Teams could do the job.
And when debugging or needing quick help, do not hesitate to do short voice/video calls to make things done faster.

Also, keep some time to relax. At the office you usually take coffee breaks or queue for the restroom, right?
