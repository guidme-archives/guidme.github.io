#### Welcome visitor,

And thanks for checking our Tech Blog!

We, Guidâ€™me, are a French company that helps travelers to enjoy the their trip by finding local guides.
This website will contains blog posts and open source projects made by Guid'me.

It is important for us to learn about Tech Writing for many reasons.

First it is an important personal skills for tech people. Most of developers around the world are good at coding, but only a few can can write about it.

It is also important as it helps us to keep track of what we have done and remember how much we have progressed.

It will also gives us some visibility on the Tech side, and some people might be interested to work with us!

As university students, it was super interesting to create this app. But we were missing experiences and the Tech Debt got huge over time.
It has been quite a challenge to pay this debt, and improving the quality to deliver a resilient app.


Anyway, this is the beginning of our company tech blog, we hope you will find helpful information.
We are not doing perfect, but we learn and improve everyday. And this is what we want to share.

Thank you for reading.
